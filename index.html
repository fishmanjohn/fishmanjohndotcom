        <p>I am a builder, it doesn't really matter what I am building. 
            I pay close attention to the small details that make up the whole product. I have been referred to as a man of few words, I prefer to let my work speak for itself.
             I want to bring that attention to detail to your next project. Please take a look at my <a href='work.html' >work</a> and let it do the talking.</p>
