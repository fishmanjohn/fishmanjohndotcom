        <p>My name is John Marshall. I love to build things, whether it's web applications or bicycles. I live in Bend, Oregon, but I call many different places home. 
            My specialties include Javascript, React, Node.Js and Python. 
            After almost a decade spent as a technician in the bicycle industry, I’ve developed strong problem solving, communication and conflict resolution skills.
             I am interested in combining these skills with web technologies to help build cutting edge projects that will benefit and enrich the lives of their users.</p>
        <p>When I'm not programming, I’m likely mountain biking, snowboarding, 
            fly fishing or on a surf trip in search of the perfect wave. If you would like to know more about me and what makes me tick, feel free 
            <a href = "contact.html">to get in touch</a> or take a look at some of my <a href="work.html">projects</a>.</p>
